Notice
> In this stage of the project, superior ways-of-doing-things might be
  found in the near future which can make the API unstable. The code
  also needs more real-world- and unit-tests, so do not use this for
  critical production software. Please report any bugs when found.

Uses:
- Instant messenger for the paranoid.
- Iot.
- Easy integration of Iot device with existing XMPP software.
- Pub-Sub client for e.g. RSS.
- Integrating chat into a video game.

Goals:
- Run on embedded (support for ESP-IDF (ESP32) & (hopefully) pico-sdk (Raspberry Pi
  Pico [W])).
- Support non-embedded (Desktop, etc.) too.
- Be compatible with the major XMPP servers (Prosody guaranteed).
- Don't allow unusual or malicious data sent from a server.
- Be very fast.
- Low amount of code while still being readable.
- Don't expect the programmer (consumer of this API) to be stupid.
- Extreme control of memory (when possible).
- Have the modern XMPP features available.

Non-goals:
- Implement the XMPP spec word-for-word.
- Have an extension/plugin system, for additional features you must
  patch the library.

Dependencies:
- MbedTLS
- C99 compiler
