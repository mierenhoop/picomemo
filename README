Goals:
- Run on embedded (support for ESP-IDF (ESP32) & pico-sdk (Raspberry Pi Pico)).
- Support non-embedded too.
- Be compatible with the major XMPP servers (Prosody).
- Don't allow unusual or malicious data sent from a server.
- Be very fast.
- Low amount of code while still being readable.
- Don't expect the programmer to be stupid.
- Extreme control of memory.
- Have the modern XMPP features available.

Non-goals:
- Implement the XMPP spec word-for-word.
- Have an extension/plugin system, for additional features you must patch the library.
